# NAVTEX & SITOR-B

NAVTEX (Navigational Telex) is a maritime safety broadcast system using SITOR-B (AMTOR-B) modulation with Forward Error Correction. It transmits weather warnings, navigational warnings, and safety information to ships at sea using FSK modulation with CCIR-476 encoding.

PyDigi's NAVTEX implementation supports both full NAVTEX protocol (with headers and phasing) and raw SITOR-B mode for general teletype applications.

For detailed usage examples and guides, see the [NAVTEX User Guide](../../examples/navtex.md).
