# WEFAX (Weather Facsimile)

WEFAX is a weather facsimile mode used to transmit images and text, particularly weather maps, satellite imagery, and weather bulletins. WEFAX transmits grayscale images using FM modulation where pixel grayscale values are mapped to audio frequencies.

PyDigi's WEFAX implementation supports both WEFAX-576 and WEFAX-288 modes, with automatic text-to-image rendering for weather bulletins and text-based reports.

For detailed usage examples and guides, see the [WEFAX User Guide](../../examples/wefax.md).
